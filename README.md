# FortRush
Fort Rush is a game made for Blinks
Players: 2-Infinite!
Play Time: 10-15 Min.

___Setup___
Start by configuring the fort that the teams will be trying to Take. 
The green sections of the Blinks show what parts of the fort must be taken to capture that piece.
When the fort is set up how you want it, each player (or team depending on how many blinks you have)
takes one of the blinks for their troops and long presses it to turn it into a troops piece.
Teams can coordinate teams by single clicking the Blinks.
To capture the fort pieces, stand around a table and slide your blinks towards the fort!
If a red side connects to a green fort piece you have defeated that portion of the fort piece.
the player who takes the last green slice of a fort piece takes that fort piece off the fort for their own.
when the fort is all taken by teams/players the game is over and whoever has the most pieces wins!

Reset at any point by triple clicking the blinks.
