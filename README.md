# FortRush
Fort Rush is a game made for Blinks

Players: 2-Infinite!
Play Time: 10-15 Min.

___Setup___
Start by configuring the fort that the teams will be trying to Take. 
The green sections of the Blinks show what parts of the fort must be taken to capture that piece.
When the fort is set up how you want it, triple click a fort piece to begin the game.
Each player (or team depending on how many blinks you have)
takes one of the blinks for their troops and long presses it to turn it into a troops piece.
Teams can coordinate teams by double clicking the Blinks.

__Play__
To capture the fort pieces, stand around a table and slide your blinks towards the fort!
If your troop's side connects to a green fort piece you have defeated that portion of the fort piece and the green wall will crumble
when a fort piece is defeated it will turn the color of the troops who captured it
when the fort is all taken by teams/players the game is over and whoever has the most pieces wins!

watch out for guards! they will randomly pop up to protect their section of the fort. if you connect to a green wall with a guard behind it you will not defeat that wall section. When enough sections of a fort piece are captured so that there is a hole in the fort wall, guards will randomly defend these spots as well. if your troops connect with a guard piece directly they'll suffer casualties! the dead troop will no longe be able to take walls. if you suffer casualties twice you lose your troops and are out of the game. 

Reset at any point by single clicking the blinks.
